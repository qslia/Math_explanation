题意：当 $x \to 0^+$ 时，判断哪一个无穷小 **与 $x$ 等价**（即 $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to0^+}\frac{f(x)}{x}=1)$。

逐个用泰勒展开判断：

---

**(A)** $e^{-\sin x}-1$

$$
\sin x \sim x \quad\Rightarrow\quad e^{-\sin x}-1 \sim -\sin x \sim -x
$$

$$
\frac{e^{-\sin x}-1}{x} \to -1 \neq 1
$$

❌ 不等价于 (x)

---

**(B)** $\sqrt{1+x}-\cos x$

$$
\sqrt{1+x} \sim 1+\frac{x}{2}, \quad \cos x \sim 1-\frac{x^2}{2}

$$

✅ **与 (x) 等价**

---

**(D)** $1-\dfrac{\ln(1+x)}{x}$

$$

$$
1-\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} \sim \frac{x}{2}
$$

❌ 不等价于 (x)

---

### ✅ 最终答案：**(C)**
---
Good question — this is a **key concept** in calculus 👍
Let me explain it **plainly and gently**.

---

## What does **“等价”** mean?

In limits, **等价 (equivalent)** means:

> Two functions become **almost the same size** when (x) is very close to 0.

Formally, we say
(f(x)) is **等价于** (g(x)) as (x \to 0) if

[
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1
]

---

## What does that mean in simple words?

As (x) gets extremely small:

* (f(x)) and (g(x))
* **go to zero at the same speed**
* neither is bigger or smaller than the other

So writing
[
f(x) \sim g(x)
]
means

> “Near 0, (f(x)) behaves just like (g(x)).”

---

## Easy examples 🌱

### Example 1

[
\sin x \sim x \quad (x\to 0)
]

Because:
[
\frac{\sin x}{x} \to 1
]

So near 0:

* (\sin 0.001 \approx 0.001)

---

### Example 2

[
1-\cos x \sim \frac{x^2}{2}
]

Because:
[
\frac{1-\cos x}{x^2/2} \to 1
]

---

### Example 3 (NOT equivalent)

[
\sqrt{x} \not\sim x
]

Because:
[
\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \to \infty
]

They go to zero at **different speeds** ❌

---

## In YOUR question

The problem asks:

> Which expression is **等价于 (x)** as (x \to 0^+)?

That means:

> Which expression behaves like (x) when (x) is very small?

We check:
[
\frac{\text{expression}}{x} \to 1 \ ?
]

Only **option (C)** satisfies this.

---

## Why teachers love 等价 ❤️

Because it lets you:

* simplify limits
* replace complicated expressions with simple ones
* calculate limits fast

---

If you want, I can:

* give you a **one-line rule sheet**
* show **graphs** to visualize 等价
* or give you **practice problems**

Just tell me 😊
---
Got it — you want **that line** explained carefully:

[
e^{-\sin x}-1 \sim -\sin x \sim -x
]

Let’s go **slow, step by step**, and keep it intuitive.

---

## Step 1️⃣ Why does

[
e^{-\sin x}-1 \sim -\sin x \quad (x\to0)
]
hold?

This comes from a **basic limit / Taylor fact**:

### Very important rule

For small (u),
[
e^{u}-1 \sim u
]

Why? Because
[
e^{u} = 1 + u + \frac{u^2}{2} + \cdots
]

So when (u) is tiny, higher powers disappear, leaving:
[
e^{u}-1 \approx u
]

---

### Apply it here

Take
[
u = -\sin x
]

As (x\to0),
[
\sin x \to 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad u \to 0
]

So:
[
e^{-\sin x}-1 \sim -\sin x
]

That’s **why the first “(\sim)” is true**.

---

## Step 2️⃣ Why does

[
-\sin x \sim -x
]
hold?

Another **fundamental limit**:

[
\sin x \sim x \quad (x\to0)
]

Multiplying by (-1) does **not** change equivalence:
[
-\sin x \sim -x
]

---

## Step 3️⃣ Put them together

If:
[
e^{-\sin x}-1 \sim -\sin x
]
and
[
-\sin x \sim -x
]

Then:
[
e^{-\sin x}-1 \sim -x
]

This is called **transitivity of equivalence**.

---

## Step 4️⃣ Why this means it’s NOT equivalent to (x)

To be equivalent to (x), we need:
[
\frac{e^{-\sin x}-1}{x} \to 1
]

But since:
[
e^{-\sin x}-1 \sim -x
]

we get:
[
\frac{e^{-\sin x}-1}{x} \to -1
]

❌ Not equal to 1 → **not equivalent**

---

## One-sentence intuition 💡

> Near 0, (e^{-\sin x}-1) behaves like **(-x)**, not (x).

---

If you want, I can:

* explain this **using a graph**
* explain **why (e^u-1\sim u)** without Taylor
* give you a **rule list** for fast exams

Just tell me 🙂
---
Great question — this is exactly the *right* thing to ask 👌
Short answer first, then real uses.

---

## One-sentence answer

**“等价” is used to simplify limits by replacing complicated expressions with simpler ones that behave the same near a point.**

---

## 1️⃣ The most common use: **calculating limits fast**

Instead of doing hard algebra, you **swap** expressions for their equivalents.

### Example

[
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{1-\cos x}{x^2}
]

Use equivalence:
[
1-\cos x \sim \frac{x^2}{2}
]

So the limit becomes:
[
\frac{x^2/2}{x^2} \to \frac12
]

✅ Done in one line.

---

## 2️⃣ Handling ugly expressions 😵‍💫

### Example

[
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sqrt{1+x}-1}{x}
]

Equivalence:
[
\sqrt{1+x}-1 \sim \frac{x}{2}
]

So:
[
\frac{x/2}{x} \to \frac12
]

No rationalizing, no mess.

---

## 3️⃣ Comparing “speed” of going to zero 🚗

It answers questions like:

> Which goes to zero faster?

* (x)
* (x^2)
* (1-\cos x)
* (\sin x)

Using equivalence:

* (\sin x \sim x)
* (1-\cos x \sim x^2/2)

So:

* (x^2) goes to zero **faster** than (x)

This matters in:

* error analysis
* approximations
* numerical methods

---

## 4️⃣ Simplifying integrals and series (advanced, but important)

Example:
[
\int_0^\varepsilon \frac{1-\cos x}{x^2},dx
]

Near 0:
[
\frac{1-\cos x}{x^2} \sim \frac12
]

So the integral **converges**.

This idea appears in:

* improper integrals
* convergence tests
* Fourier analysis

---

## 5️⃣ Real-world intuition 🌍

Engineers and scientists do this all the time:

* **Physics**: small-angle approximation
  (\sin\theta \approx \theta)
* **Engineering**: linearization near equilibrium
* **Economics**: local approximations of models
* **Machine learning**: Taylor approximations

They’re all using **equivalence**.

---

## 6️⃣ Exam survival kit 🧠🔥

Teachers love it because it lets you:

* solve limits in seconds
* avoid algebra traps
* show mathematical maturity

Typical exam phrasing:

> “Find the equivalent infinitesimal”

That’s code for:

> “Replace this with something simpler.”

---

## Mental model to remember 💡

Think of **等价** as:

> “Near this point, I can safely pretend this complicated thing *is* this simple thing.”

---

If you want, next I can:

* give a **cheat sheet** of the 10 most important equivalents
* show **when you are NOT allowed** to use equivalence (very important!)
* give **practice problems with solutions**

Just say the word 😊
---
Perfect — let’s explain **this exact statement** very clearly:

[
1-\cos x \sim \frac{x^2}{2}\quad (x\to0)
]

I’ll avoid shortcuts and show **why this is true**, step by step.

---

## What does this statement mean?

It means:
[
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{1-\cos x}{x^2/2}=1
]

So near (x=0),
(1-\cos x) behaves **almost exactly like** (\dfrac{x^2}{2}).

---

## Method 1️⃣ (most intuitive): using geometry / known limit

We know a **basic limit**:
[
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{1-\cos x}{x^2}=\frac12
]

Multiply both sides by (x^2):
[
1-\cos x \sim \frac{x^2}{2}
]

That’s literally the definition of equivalence.

---

## Method 2️⃣ (most common): Taylor expansion (but gently)

The cosine function has this expansion near 0:
[
\cos x = 1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^4}{24}-\cdots
]

Subtract from 1:
[
1-\cos x = \frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x^4}{24}+\cdots
]

When (x) is very small:

* (x^4) is **tiny** compared to (x^2)

So:
[
1-\cos x \approx \frac{x^2}{2}
]

That’s exactly what “(\sim)” means.

---

## Method 3️⃣ (no Taylor, just logic)

Near 0:

* cosine curve is **flat**
* its first derivative at 0 is 0
* the **first nonzero change** is quadratic

So the leading term **must** be proportional to (x^2)

The coefficient turns out to be (\frac12).

---

## Numerical check (very convincing)

Take (x=0.01):

[
1-\cos(0.01)\approx 0.0000499996
]
[
\frac{x^2}{2}=\frac{0.0001}{2}=0.00005
]

They’re almost the same.

---

## Key intuition 💡

> Near zero, cosine doesn’t change linearly — it changes **quadratically**.

That’s why:
[
1-\cos x \sim \frac{x^2}{2}
]

---

## Why this matters

Whenever you see:

* (1-\cos(\text{something small}))

You can **immediately replace it** with:
[
\frac{(\text{something})^2}{2}
]

This saves massive time in limits.

---

If you want, I can also:

* prove it **without limits**
* show a **graph**
* explain **why sine is linear but cosine is quadratic**

Just tell me 👍
---
Ahhh, perfect — now I see **exactly** what you want explained 👍
Let’s explain **only this** clearly and slowly:

[
\sqrt{1+x}-1 ;\sim; \frac{x}{2}\qquad (x\to 0)
]

No skipping. No fancy words.

---

## What this statement means

It means:
[
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sqrt{1+x}-1}{x/2}=1
]

So when (x) is **very small**,
[
\sqrt{1+x}-1 \approx \frac{x}{2}
]

---

## Step 1️⃣ Make the expression simpler (key trick)

The problem with
(\sqrt{1+x}-1)
is the square root. So we **remove it** by multiplying by the conjugate:

[
\sqrt{1+x}-1
= \frac{(\sqrt{1+x}-1)(\sqrt{1+x}+1)}{\sqrt{1+x}+1}
]

Numerator becomes:
[
(1+x)-1 = x
]

So:
[
\sqrt{1+x}-1 = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x}+1}
]

---

## Step 2️⃣ Look at what happens near (x=0)

As (x \to 0):

* (\sqrt{1+x} \to 1)
* so (\sqrt{1+x}+1 \to 2)

Therefore:
[
\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x}+1} \approx \frac{x}{2}
]

---

## Step 3️⃣ Turn this into equivalence

Now divide by (\frac{x}{2}):

[
\frac{\sqrt{1+x}-1}{x/2}
= \frac{\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x}+1}}{x/2}
= \frac{2}{\sqrt{1+x}+1}
]

Take the limit:
[
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{2}{\sqrt{1+x}+1} = \frac{2}{2}=1
]

✅ That **proves**:
[
\sqrt{1+x}-1 \sim \frac{x}{2}
]

---

## Intuition (this is the most important part)

Near (x=0):

* the square root function is **almost a straight line**
* its slope at 0 is (\frac12)

So increasing (x) a little bit increases (\sqrt{1+x}) by about (\frac{x}{2}).

That’s why:
[
\sqrt{1+x}-1 \approx \frac{x}{2}
]

---

## One-line memory rule 🧠

When (x) is small:
[
\boxed{\sqrt{1+x} \approx 1+\frac{x}{2}}
]

Subtract 1:
[
\boxed{\sqrt{1+x}-1 \sim \frac{x}{2}}
]

---

If you want next, I can:

* explain **why the slope is (1/2)**
* compare this with (e^x-1 \sim x)
* give **practice problems** until it feels automatic

Just tell me 🙂
---
Perfect — now it’s clear 👍
You want **this** explained:

[
\ln(1+x);\sim; x-\frac{x^2}{2}\qquad (x\to0)
]

Let’s do it **slowly, cleanly, and from the ground up**.

---

## 1️⃣ What this statement means (no shortcuts)

[
\ln(1+x)\sim x-\frac{x^2}{2}
]

means:

> When (x) is very small,
> (\ln(1+x)) behaves like (x-\dfrac{x^2}{2}).

Formally:
[
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x-\frac{x^2}{2}}=1
]

---

## 2️⃣ Where does it come from? (the idea)

The function (\ln(1+x)) is **smooth** near (x=0), so near 0 it can be approximated by a **polynomial**.

Think of zooming in very close to (x=0):

* curves start to look like straight lines
* then slightly curved lines

That’s why we approximate step by step.

---

## 3️⃣ First step: linear approximation

Consider the limit:
[
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}=1
]

This tells us:
[
\ln(1+x)\sim x
]

So the **main (largest) term** is (x).

---

## 4️⃣ Second step: improve the accuracy

But (x) alone is **not accurate enough**.

The error between (\ln(1+x)) and (x) is about order (x^2).

In fact:
[
\ln(1+x) - x \sim -\frac{x^2}{2}
]

So we refine the approximation:
[
\ln(1+x)\approx x-\frac{x^2}{2}
]

This is the **first two terms** of the expansion.

---

## 5️⃣ (Optional but enlightening) Taylor expansion

The Taylor series of (\ln(1+x)) at 0 is:
[
\ln(1+x)
= x-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3}-\frac{x^4}{4}+\cdots
]

When (x\to0):

* (x^3, x^4,\dots) are **much smaller** than (x^2)

So we keep only the important terms:
[
\ln(1+x)\sim x-\frac{x^2}{2}
]

---

## 6️⃣ Numerical check (very convincing)

Take (x=0.01):

[
\ln(1.01)\approx 0.00995033
]

[
x-\frac{x^2}{2}
=0.01-\frac{0.0001}{2}
=0.00995
]

Almost identical ✔

---

## 7️⃣ Why this is useful (connected to your earlier question)

This is why we can say:
[
\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}\sim 1-\frac{x}{2}
]

and therefore:
[
1-\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}\sim \frac{x}{2}
]

That step appears **all the time** in limit problems.

---

## Key intuition 💡 (remember this)

> Near 0,
> (\ln(1+x)) grows almost like (x),
> but slightly **slower**, and the correction is (-\frac{x^2}{2}).

---

## One-line memory rule 🧠

When (x) is small:
[
\boxed{\ln(1+x)\approx x-\frac{x^2}{2}}
]

---

If you want next, I can:

* explain **why the coefficient is exactly (1/2)**
* show **how many terms you need in exams**
* explain **when you must NOT use this approximation**

Just say the word 🙂
