Great question! The formula in the image is the **Binomial Distribution Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:

$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

It tells us the probability of getting exactly **(k) successes** in **(n) independent trials**, where each trial has a success probability (p).

---

### Breaking it down:

1. **(X)**

   * A random variable that counts the number of successes.

2. **Parameters (n) and (p)**

   * (n): number of independent trials.
   * (p): probability of success in a single trial.
   * Example: Tossing a coin 10 times ((n=10)), with (p=0.5) for heads.

3. **(k)**

   * The exact number of successes we are interested in.
   * Example: "What‚Äôs the probability of getting exactly 3 heads?"

4. **$\binom{n}{k}$** (read ‚Äún choose k‚Äù)

   * Counts how many different ways (k) successes can occur among (n) trials.
   * Formula:
     [
     \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     ]

5. **$p^k$**

   * Probability of getting success (k) times.

6. **$(1-p)^{n-k}$**

   * Probability of getting failure in the remaining ((n-k)) trials.

### Intuition:

The binomial distribution is about **success/failure experiments** (also called Bernoulli trials).
It combines **combinatorics** (how many ways can this happen?) with **probabilities** (how likely is each way?).

---

### Example:

Suppose you flip a fair coin (n = 5) times ((p=0.5)).
What‚Äôs the probability of exactly (k = 2) heads?

$$
P(X=2) = \binom{5}{2} (0.5)^2 (0.5)^{3}
$$
$$
= \frac{5!}{2!3!} (0.25)(0.125)
= 10 \cdot 0.03125 = 0.3125
$$

So there‚Äôs about a **31.25% chance** of getting exactly 2 heads in 5 flips.

üëâ Want me to also show you how the **expected value** and **variance** are derived from this formula?
