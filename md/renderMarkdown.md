Perfect! I've updated the file with proper LaTeX syntax for markdown rendering. The changes include:

✅ **Display math blocks**: Changed `[` `]` to `$$` for the main formula and examples
✅ **Inline math**: Changed `(` `)` to `$` for all inline formulas (variables, fractions, etc.)
✅ **Added a proper title**: Added `# Expected Value Formula` at the top

The markdown will now render correctly in any viewer that supports LaTeX/MathJax, including GitHub, VS Code markdown preview, Jupyter notebooks, and most modern markdown editors!
